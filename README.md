# OOP Lab Programs

This repository contains various Java programs written for my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Lab.  
Each folder is organized based on different Java concepts and topics.

## Folder Structure

- **ArrayDemo**  
  Programs demonstrating one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.

- **BoxDemo**  
  Programs about classes, objects, constructors, and method overloading.

- **DateClassDemo**  
  Programs using the `Date` and `SimpleDateFormat` classes for working with dates and times.

- **EnumerationWrapperClass**  
  Examples of using `enum` types and wrapper classes in Java.

- **FileIOPrograms**  
  Programs covering file handling, reading/writing files, serialization, and directory operations.

- **InitialClasses**  
  Basic Java programs like Hello World, loops, data type conversions, and command-line input.

- **Others**  
  Miscellaneous files and test programs.

- **StringClass**  
  String handling programs using `String` and `StringBuffer` classes.

- **ThreadPrograms**  
  Programs that demonstrate creating threads, synchronization, and inter-thread communication.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to any `src` folder of the topic you want.
2. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled class:
   ```bash
   java ClassName
   ```

## Notes

- Java version used: **JDK 8+**
- Each folder has a `bin/` directory for compiled `.class` files and a `src/` directory for `.java` source code.
- Focused on understanding and practicing OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, threading, exception handling, and file operations.
